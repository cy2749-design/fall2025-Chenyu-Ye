            <p>Dear Sarah,</p>
            
            
            <p>I'm writing this in the morning, after everything that happened last night. I thought a lot before putting these words down.</p>
            
            <p>Sometimes I react too quickly in the moment, and I say things I don't really mean, or I don't say the things I actually want to say. This letter is my attempt to slow down and really think about what matters.</p>
            
            <p>What I want you to know is that our friendship means everything to me. I know we both have strong feelings, and sometimes those feelings collide. But that doesn't change how much I care about you.</p>
            
            <p>I've been reflecting on what happened, and I realize that my hurt was showing up as anger. I should have found a better way to express what I was feeling instead of letting it explode. That wasn't fair to you.</p>
            
            <p>I'm not asking you to accept everything right away, or even at all. I just wanted you to know that I see you, I hear you, and I want to understand. Maybe we both needed space to let the dust settle.</p>
            
            <p>This letter won't solve everything, but I hope it shows you that I'm trying. I'm trying to be better, to be gentler with my words, and to give us both the time we need.</p>
            
            <p>I'm sending this because I believe in us. And because sometimes love means choosing your words carefully.</p>
            
            <p>Yours,</p>
        </div>
